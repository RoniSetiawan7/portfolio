The tech world is where I thrive, and I enjoy every second of itâ€”whether it's writing code that makes me smile or debugging bugs that stress me out.\n\nHere, you'll find various projects I've worked on, from web applications to software that might make life a little easier (or at least not more complicated). I always strive to write clean and easy-to-understand code, because I believe the world is complicated enough without having to struggle with long lines of code.\n\nNote: If you're also a programmer, I hope you don't find any bugs here... fingers crossed ðŸ˜‰.",
