The tech world is where I work, and I enjoy every second of it-from writing code that makes me smile, to debugging bugs that make me stressed.\n\nHere, you'll find various projects I've worked on, ranging from web applications to software that might make life easier (or at least less complicated). I always try to create code that is clean and easy to understand, because I believe the world is complicated enough without being confused by long lines of code.\n\nNote: If you're also a programmer, I hope you don't find any bugs here... fingers crossed ðŸ˜‰.",
